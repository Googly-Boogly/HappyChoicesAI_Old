HappyChoicesAI Architecture Document
1. Introduction
Project Overview

HappyChoicesAI is a utilitarian ethicist AI designed to help users make ethical decisions by analyzing their input dilemmas and suggesting the most ethical actions based on utilitarian principles. This document describes the system architecture, technologies used, and the development approach.
Objective

To develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the HappyChoicesAI that can:

    Receive and process user-input ethical dilemmas.
    Analyze these dilemmas using a combination of AI technologies.
    Recommend actions based on the potential to maximize happiness and minimize suffering.

2. Technology Stack

    Programming Language: Python
    Main Libraries/Technologies:
        CrewAI for cognitive architecture.
        MetaGPT for advanced language model capabilities.
        Django for backend web application framework.
        Docker for containerization.
        Langchain for leveraging language models.
        Argparse for command-line interface management.
    Database:
        MySQL for storing user data and ethical dilemmas.
        Pinecone for a vector database (optional, based on cost and availability).
    Version Control and CI/CD:
        Git and GitHub for source code management.
        GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
    Testing:
        pytest for unit tests.

3. System Architecture
High-Level Components

    Input Module:
        Interface for users to submit their ethical dilemmas.
        Includes CLI and potentially a web interface.

    Processing Module:
        Utilizes CrewAI and Langchain to process and understand the ethical dilemmas.
        MetaGPT supports deep learning insights.

    Decision-Making Module:
        Analyzes processed information.
        Calculates potential outcomes using a utilitarian scoring system.

    Output Module:
        Provides the user with the recommended action and an explanation.
        Uses utilitarian ethics principles.

    Feedback System:
        Captures user feedback for improving the AIâ€™s accuracy and relevance.

4. Security and Compliance

    Initial focus will be on developing the core functionalities.
    Basic security measures like data encryption and secure data handling will be implemented from the start.
    Compliance measures will be designed in alignment with data protection regulations as the project evolves.

5. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup and Initial Research

    Define requirements, select tools, set up development environment, and sketch out basic architectural design.

Phase 2: Core Development

    Develop the major functionalities such as input processing, decision logic, basic user interface, and historical data retrieval.

Phase 3: Refinement and Initial Testing

    Enhance features, implement the explanation mechanism, establish a basic feedback system, and conduct preliminary tests.

Phase 4: Final Adjustments and Presentation

    Finalize the MVP, improve the user interface, conduct final tests, and prepare a demo.

6. Future Considerations

    Expanding to support multiple languages.
    Integrating additional ethical frameworks.
    Developing full security protocols.
    Forming partnerships with ethical scholars.
    Performance optimization as the system scales.

7. Conclusion

HappyChoicesAI aims to pioneer in the field of AI-driven ethical decision-making by combining advanced AI technology with philosophical principles to deliver a practical and scalable solution for everyday ethical dilemmas.
